          Welcome to <strong>Code in Ctrl</strong> â€” a collaborative tech and engineering
          blog built by students, creators, and future innovators. Iâ€™m <strong>Godwin Azuka</strong>, an <em>Electronic and Computer Engineering student</em> at the 
          <strong> University of Science and Technology in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland</strong>,
          and I founded Code in Ctrl to bridge the worlds of <strong>software, hardware, and innovation</strong> through hands-on learning.
